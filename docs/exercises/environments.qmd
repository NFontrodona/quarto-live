```{webr}
#| edit: false
# Assignment in non-exercise blocks are put into the global environment
foo <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
```

----

Exercises can see variables in both the global and exercise environment

```{webr}
#| exercise: example_1
#| setup: true
# Assignment in setup blocks are put into the exercise environment
bar <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
```

```{webr}
#| caption: Sample Exercise
#| exercise: example_1
# Exercise can see setup and global variables
foo
bar
```

---

Exercise environments don't leak into the global environment

```{webr}
#| caption: Global
# Only global environment
foo
bar
```

----

Environments can be managed manually, if you wish:

```{webr}
#| edit: false
#| envir: myenv
foo <- 7
```

```{webr}
#| edit: false
#| envir: myenv
bar <- 5
```

```{webr}
#| envir: myenv
foo + bar
```
