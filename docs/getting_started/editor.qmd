The `quarto-live` extension provides WebAssembly powered cells that can be used in Quarto HTML documents to provide dynamic evaluation of user provided code and data visualisation.

## Interactive editor

Add an interactive editor to your Quarto HTML document using the `webr` code cell for R code, or the `pyodide` code cell for Python code. The editor will be pre-populated with the original contents of the code cell. The code can be changed by the user and evaluated by clicking the "Run Code" button.

#### Source

::: {.panel-tabset}

# R

````markdown
```{{webr}}
for (x in 1:5) {
  print(10 + x)
}
```
````

# Python

````markdown
```{{pyodide}}
for x in range(5):
  print(10 + x)
```
````

:::

#### Output

```{webr}
for (x in 1:5) {
  print(10 + x)
}
```

## Read-only cells

Setting `edit: false` will create a read-only cell. Read only cells are displayed similarly to the usual pre-rendered code blocks, but are executed on the client under WebAssembly.

#### Source

````markdown
```{{webr}}
#| edit: false
df <- data.frame(foo = c(1, 2, 3), bar = c(10, 20, 30))
df$foo
df$bar
```
````

#### Output

```{webr}
#| edit: false
df <- data.frame(foo = c(1, 2, 3), bar = c(10, 20, 30))
df$foo
df$bar
```

::: {.callout-note}
In this mode only the source code will be shown when the page initially loads. After the WebAssembly engine has finished loading and evaluating the code, its output will be added to the cell dynamically.
:::

## Autorun

Initial code cell contents will be automatically executed[^ex] once the WebAssembly engine has loaded into the page. That is, you do not need to click "Run Code" to see the initial evaluation output. However, this autorun feature can be disabled by setting `autorun: false`.

[^ex]: Note that code exercises do not autorun by default, see [Exercises and Grading](../exercises/exercises.qmd) for details.

#### Source

````markdown
```{{webr}}
#| autorun: false
123 + 456
```
````

#### Output

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
123 + 456
```

## Immediate Execution

Setting `runbutton: false` will remove the "Run Code" button from the editor UI. In this mode code is evaluated immediately as it is entered into the editor.

#### Source

````markdown
```{{webr}}
#| caption: Immediate Execution
#| runbutton: false
foo <- 123
bar <- 246
foo + bar
```
````

#### Output

```{webr}
#| caption: Immediate Execution
#| runbutton: false
foo <- 123
bar <- 246
foo + bar
```

::: {.callout-warning}
With immediate execution code is executed as it is typed, including partially completed statements. This means that you may see error messages flashing by as code is entered or modified in the editor.

This might be distracting and confusing for new learners, and so this mode should be used carefully. A debouncing feature is planned for the future to help mitigate the issue.
:::

## Autocomplete

Autocompletion code suggestions can be enabled with the code cell option `completion: true`.

#### Source

````markdown
```{{webr}}
#| completion: true
n_mean <- 120
n_sd <- 5

# Type "n_" to see context aware suggestions
```
````

#### Output

```{webr}
#| completion: true
n_mean <- 120
n_sd <- 5

# Type "n_" to see context aware suggestions
```

## Code persistence

Initial editor contents are stored and can be recalled at any time by clicking the "Start Over" button. If required, the "Start Over" button can be disabled by setting the `startover: false` cell option.

#### Source

````markdown
```{{webr}}
#| startover: false
foo <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
foo + 1
```
````

#### Output

```{webr}
#| startover: false
foo <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
foo + 1
```

Code entered by users may be automatically persisted in web browser local storage by setting the `localstorage: true` option. When enabled, evaluated code is persisted and will be recalled into the editor when the HTML document is reloaded.

#### Source

````markdown
```{{webr}}
#| localstorage: true
foo <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
foo + 1
```
````

#### Output

```{webr}
#| localstorage: true
foo <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
foo + 1
```

::: {.callout-note}
The "Start Over" button will restore the original code block contents, overriding any code that has been persisted in browser storage.
:::

## Execution time limit

Setting the `timelimit` code cell option will set a time limit for code execution, in seconds. This provides a useful escape hatch for problematic user code that is very long running or stuck in an infinite loop.

The default time limit is 30 seconds and setting `timelimit: 0` will disable the limit.

#### Source

````markdown
```{{webr}}
#| autorun: false
#| timelimit: 3
while (TRUE) {
  # Loop, infinitely
}
```
````

#### Output

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
#| timelimit: 3
while (TRUE) {
  # Loop, infinitely
}
```

## Cross References

Cross-references to interactive code listings should be written using fenced div syntax. Create a fenced div with an `id` starting with `lst-`, then include the interactive code cell followed by the caption.

````markdown

```{{webr}}
mod <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
summary(mod)
```

An interactive R code block, with an example of fitting a linear model.
